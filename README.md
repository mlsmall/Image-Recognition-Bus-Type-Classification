# Image-Recognition-Bus-Type-Classification

This deep learning model is the result of the assigment for lesson 1 of the fastai course for Fall 2018. It was built using the fastai ai library, which sits on top of Pytorch v1. The GPU used was an NVIDIA P4 GPU with 8 CPU's and 52 GB of RAM run from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This is an image classifier model that can tell the difference between 2 types of buses used in Panama city. The classic type called *Diablo Rojo* that is being phased out. And the modern ones called *Metrobus*. The accuracy of the model on a validation set was 98.2%. As you can see itâ€™s pretty easy to tell the difference.
